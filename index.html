            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
            <p>CrowdFinder is a system that allows people to connect and find times to plan events according to availabilities they list on a calendar.

                CrowdFinder is primarily designed for busy people who want an easy way to plan events with others. 
                It is valuable because people's availability is visible from the start, and you don't have to spend time individually reaching out and waiting for responses. 
                This creates a way for people to communicate about events more effectively all in one place. 
                For people with larger constraints, they can even have times suggested to them to streamline planning events further.
                
                In CrowdFinder you can visually see your availability on a calendar indicating times during which you are fully available. 
                Empty time slots in the calendar indicate that you are busy. 
                Along with your own availability, you can view the availability of people you are connected with, called contacts. 
                These contacts are the people who you create events with by finding overlapping availability.
                
                Creating events involves selecting the contacts that you would like to invite. You can select a date and time according to all contacts' availabilities. 
                Contacts invited to events will be asked to either accept or reject the event request to indicate whether they will attend. 
                They will also be able to suggest adjustments such as different date or time, by commenting on the event request. 
                If there is a group of people you often see and plan events with, a group can be created.
                
                The events you have been invited to and created will be collected in an event history, including events that have happened and those that are yet to happen. 
                If you have declined an upcoming event, you can find it in the event history and accept it if you changed your mind. 
                Likewise, you can decline an event that you previously accepted if your plans change.
                
                CrowdFinder can also suggest an optimal time for an event when most contacts are available.
                
                This project is considered a success when it significantly reduces the time and effort it takes to pick out a date and time for an event that includes a group of at least 6 people with conflicting schedules. 
                By using this project as a tool, anyone from the target audience should be able to organize an event which includes all 6 people in a more efficient manner. 
                In contrast, without this platform one would often have to wait for a response from each of the 6 potential attendees. 
                This can take a very long time in addition to finding a good window for an activity that everyone can attend.  </p>

            <h2>Major Functionality</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calendar View:</strong> Visually see  when you and your contacts are available. This calendar follows a simple style that lets you see your availability in coloured blocks. It can be viewed in terms of days or months.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Add and edit your availability on the calendar. It is assumed you are busy during blank spaces on their calendar, and are only free during specified times and dates.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Creation:</strong> Plan and organize events through event creation. An event can be any activity that includes any number of people. Created events will appear on the calendar of every user that is invited. </li>
                <li><strong>Accounts: </strong> People who wish to use Crowd Finder will be greeted with a welcome page allowing them to either login or register. Once registered, access your account on any device with CrowdFinder.</li>
                <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Look other users up and connect. Connected users remain in each other's contacts for quick access when planning events. Inspecting contacts will allow users to see the contact's availability as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Request:</strong> Invite any of your contacts to the events you plan. An invitation will always be sent to the invited contacts. Contacts then have the option to either accept or decline the invitation, notifying the original event organizer of how many people are likely to attend.</li>
                <li><strong>Event History:</strong> Users can view past events on their calendar and in Event History. If a user declines an invitation to an event, the event will not appear in their calendar, but users can still find it on the events history page.</li>
                <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Express your thoughts about event's that you are invited to so that the organizer gets some feedback while planning the event. </li>
                <li><strong>Suggest A Time:</strong> Recommends not just a date, but the best time for an event. The best time is the one during which the highest number of desired contacts can attend an event.</li>
            </ul>

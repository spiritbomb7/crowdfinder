            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
                <p>CrowdFinder is a system that allows people to connect and find times to plan events according to availabilities they list on a calendar. </p>

                <p>CrowdFinder is primarily designed for busy people who want an easy way to plan events with others. 
                It is valuable because people's availability is visible from the start, and you don't have to spend time individually reaching out and waiting for responses. 
                This creates a way for people to communicate about events more effectively all in one place. 
                For people with larger constraints, they can even have times suggested to them to streamline planning events further.</p>    
                
                <p>In CrowdFinder you can visually see your availability on a calendar indicating times during which you are fully available. 
                Empty time slots in the calendar indicate that you are busy. 
                Along with your own availability, you can view the availability of people you are connected with, called contacts. 
                These contacts are the people who you create events with by finding overlapping availability.</p>    
                
                <p> Creating events involves selecting the contacts that you would like to invite. You can select a date and time according to all contacts' availabilities. 
                Contacts invited to events will be asked to either accept or reject the event request to indicate whether they will attend. 
                They will also be able to suggest adjustments such as different date or time, by commenting on the event request. 
                If there is a group of people you often see and plan events with, a group can be created.</p>     
                
                <p>The events you have been invited to and created will be collected in an event history, including events that have happened and those that are yet to happen. 
                If you have declined an upcoming event, you can find it in the event history and accept it if you changed your mind. 
                Likewise, you can decline an event that you previously accepted if your plans change.</p>  
                
                <p> CrowdFinder can also suggest an optimal time for an event when most contacts are available.</p> 
                
                <p>This project is considered a success when it significantly reduces the time and effort it takes to pick out a date and time for an event that includes a group of at least 6 people with conflicting schedules. 
                By using this project as a tool, anyone from the target audience should be able to organize an event which includes all 6 people in a more efficient manner. 
                In contrast, without this platform one would often have to wait for a response from each of the 6 potential attendees. 
                This can take a very long time in addition to finding a good window for an activity that everyone can attend.  </p>

            <h2>Major Functionality (Features)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Calendar View:</strong> Visually see  when you and your contacts are available. This calendar follows a simple style that lets you see your availability in coloured blocks. It can be viewed in terms of days or months.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Add and edit your availability on the calendar. It is assumed you are busy during blank spaces on their calendar, and are only free during specified times and dates.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Creation:</strong> Plan and organize events through event creation. An event can be any activity that includes any number of people. Created events will appear on the calendar of every user that is invited. </li>
                <li><strong>Accounts: </strong> People who wish to use Crowd Finder will be greeted with a welcome page allowing them to either login or register. Once registered, access your account on any device with CrowdFinder.</li>
                <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Look other users up and connect. Connected users remain in each other's contacts for quick access when planning events. Inspecting contacts will allow users to see the contact's availability as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Request:</strong> Invite any of your contacts to the events you plan. An invitation will always be sent to the invited contacts. Contacts then have the option to either accept or decline the invitation, notifying the original event organizer of how many people are likely to attend.</li>
                <li><strong>Event History:</strong> Users can view past events on their calendar and in Event History. If a user declines an invitation to an event, the event will not appear in their calendar, but users can still find it on the events history page.</li>
                <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Express your thoughts about event's that you are invited to so that the organizer gets some feedback while planning the event. </li>
                <li><strong>Suggest A Time:</strong> Recommends not just a date, but the best time for an event. The best time is the one during which the highest number of desired contacts can attend an event.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Contributors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Roman Tebel:</strong> I have worked on implementing Calendar feature along with User/Event stubs, classes related to Services, Domain Specific Objects, HSQL database and unit/integration/system testing. I largely learned how to take initiative and delegate work in a way that allows to meet deadlines. It was a lot of fun planning and estimating ahead, and then getting over all the hurdles that no one could've predicted.</li>
                <li><strong>Karin Plavin:</strong> I worked on the Availability, Event Creation and Event Request features for this project. Through this project, I had the chance to work on a variety of parts of our app across all layers, which makes me feel more confident in my ability to implement different aspects of projects in the future. Learning about design patterns in class helped me identify them in our project as well, which helped me interact with and edit our code accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Jackie Mei:</strong> Throughout the project I helped with multiple features that included calendar, events creation, recommended time and availability. For calendar I did the the recyclerview that displayed the cells of the calendar and as well as the logic involving it such as populating the cells. For availability and event creation I worked on the layout of the page and the dialog that acquires input from the user. For time reccomendation, I made an algorithm that uses users availability time to calculates and return time ranges where the most people are available. From this project, I learned how to work a group using git and as well as how important communication to ensure the project goes smoothly.</li>
                <li><strong>Mahmud Ali:</strong> I was involved in creating and testing features for this project. In doing so, I learnt how to use Android Studio and its tools having no experience of it prior. I also leant how to better work in a team with the aid of a version control system and improvement in communication as the project went on.</li>
                <li><strong>Manisha Gurukumar: </strong>I contributed to the Contacts, Accounts and Event History feature throughout the duration of the project. While implementing these features alongside 
                my group I learned a lot about the communication between us. I am now able to more effectively communicate what I am working on, struggling with and when I need help. This was also my first 
                time working with a n-tier architecture and I feel as though I have a much better understanding of how elements in an application will interact to work properly. Lastly, I was able to learn 
                how to make use of design patterns in the code I write. This will help me write cleaner code in the future. </li>

                <h3>What Went Right</h3>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Vast majority of our features were completed. Only one of them couldn't be finished due to the time restraints.</li>
                    <li> Everyone would assign themselves a task and be sure to complete it. If someone could not, we were good to communicate it with each other.</li>
                    <li> The plans we made after the iteration 2 retrospective went well. We held our mid-iteration meeting as planned and attendance was 100%. This improved communication for the duration of the iteration.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Went Wrong</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout iteration 1, sometimes we would forget to assign ourself a devtask/story/feature when we started to work on it. This resulted in some
                    overlapping work happening.</li>

                    <li>There was some communication issues that developed through iteration 2. We only discussed a rough plan at the beginning of the iteration 
                    and adopted a system of just assigning ourselves tasks. This worked well for the first half, but for the remaining tasks such as testing and 
                    documentation there was some confusion on who would do what. </li>

                    <li> We had set a soft deadline for the completion of our iteration 3 features during the retrospective at the end of iteration 2. This deadline did not go 
                        as well as planned as we were not able to finish all of the features by then, but we were communicating about these delays during iteration 2.

                <ul>
                    <li> Asking each other for help on aspects of Android Studio that they had worked on previously. </li>

                <h3>Outstanding Bugs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Calendar View:</strong> Calendar sometimes gets compressed when the navigation bar changes from invisible to visible. It will also sometimes decompress
                    back to its intended size, although it is random.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Event Deletion with Comments:</strong> When trying to delete an event that has comments under it, the event will not get deleted due to an SQL exception raised 
                        due to a comment on the event. 
                    </li>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>For the most part our project worked out as predicted. We were able to implement all of the features we had dicussed except for the Groups feature. This was due to 
                    running low on time in iteration 3 and Groups required some major changes to our HSQL database which we did not have time for. Some of the features that we had planned
                    for added value beyond the basic funcationality needed for the application, like comments.

                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>Discord Web Hook:</strong> Sent out notifications whenever changes were made to the repository. We would keep using this as it improved communication and kept other team members up to date.</li>
                    <li> <strong>Visual Planning Tools (Lucid Spark):</strong> Where we put our initial visual designs of our app in a centralized and easy to edit space. Having the visuals also greatly helped implement the initial visuals of our application.</li>
                    <li> <strong>More Structured Task Delegation:</strong> It would be nice to have someone specifically who is in charge of delegating tasks to the team members, keeping track of progress and managing the milesones on GitLab. </li>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> No matter how much planning is done, little things will always come up that are time consuming especially when using an unfamiliar tool. Knowing this, 
                    it's beneficial to allocate extra time and remain flexible to account for unexpected issues that will always arise.
                    </li>
                    <li> Our overall experience was that everyone is the team contributed a fair amount to the project. This lead to a confidence in getting things done and in our team members.</li>
                    <li> Things will break with even small changes you make to the code. It's important to be attentive as you make changes to reduce errors and bugs.</li>
